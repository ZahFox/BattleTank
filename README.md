# BattleTank
An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system. This was created using Unreal Engine 4.

## Design
Concept: 
There will be 2 tanks, one controlled by the player and the other one by AI. The player and AI tanks will battle eachother until one is destroyed. This battle will take place within a low poly outdoor arena.

Rules:
1) The tank that survives the battle is the winner.
2) If your tank gets destroyed, you lose the game.
3) Aiming can only be done in certain angles: Y-axis: 70º; X-axis: 360º. This means that the tank won’t be able to aim down, unless the entire vehicle is facing downhill.
4) Colliding with another tank will cause a small amount of HP loss to both tanks.
5) The tank will be controlled with the mouse for the turret and with the WASD keys for the movement.

Requirements:
1) A tank model
2) Terrain materials
3) Tank movement and aim components
4) Physics engine for the tank projectiles
5) Menu screen
6) SFX for: projectiles, hits, misses, reloading, movement and damage.
7) Background music for the menu and the game (for the game it can be just weather effects)
